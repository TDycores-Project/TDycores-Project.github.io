Developing a predictive understanding of the terrestrial water cycle at local to global scale is
essential for accurate assessment of water resources, agricultural production, and energy generation
given current climate variability.
**TDycores** project was launched in 2018 under DOE’s Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing
([SciDAC](http://www.scidac.gov/)) program, a partnership between DOE’s Advanced Scientific Computing
Research ([ASCR](https://science.energy.gov/ascr/)) and Biological and Environmental Research
([BER](https://science.energy.gov/ber/)) Offices.
**TDycores** is focused on developing rigorously verified, spatially adaptive, scalable, multi-physics
dynamical cores for global-scale modeling of three-dimensional processes in the land and two-dimensional
processes in the river component of the [Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)](https://e3sm.org).
