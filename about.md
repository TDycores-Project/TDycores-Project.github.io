**TDycores** is focused on developing rigorously verified, spatially adaptive, scalable, multi-physics
dynamical cores for global-scale modeling of three-dimensional processes in the land and two-dimensional
processes in the river component of the [Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)](https://e3sm.org).
